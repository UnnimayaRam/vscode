    <p>A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. <br>These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware,<br> operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation<br><br>. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked<br> and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
